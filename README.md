# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-CNN-Architectures
Brain tumors pose significant health risks, necessitating precise and prompt
identification for optimal therapeutic outcomes.This abstract provides an overview
of the application of CNNs in brain tumour analysis, highlighting their potential in
improving diagnostic accuracy and aiding in clinical decision- making. The
abstract focuses on the following key aspects of CNN-based brain tumour analysis:
Data is commonly used for brain tumour analysis. Data pre- processing techniques,
including intensity normalization, image registration, and segmentation, enhance
and consistency of tumour Detection: CNN architectures, such as U-Net, V-Net,
and variants of deep CNNs, are utilized for automated brain tumour detection.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a cornerstone in the field of medical
imaging, particularly when it comes to the identification and classification of brain
tumors. By processing large volumes of annotated data, CNNs can learn to
recognize distinct patterns and spatial configurations that signify the presence of
tumors. This process involves the use of various techniques to enhance the
accuracy and reliability of these models. Data augmentation, for example, involves
artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying random
transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping. This technique helps the CNNs
generalize better to unseen data by simulating a broader range of scenarios.For
tumor classification, CNNs are employed to distinguish between different subtypes
of brain tumors. This capability is vital for personalized medicine, as the type of
tumor directly impacts the treatment approach.
